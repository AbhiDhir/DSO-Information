	<h4>Properties:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Supernova Remnant with X-Ray Source 1E 161348-5055 at its heart</li>
		<li>Constellation: Norma</li>
		<li>Right Ascension: 16h17m30s</li>
		<li>Declination: -51° 02′</li>
		<li>Distance 3,100-3,300 pc</li>
		<li>Radial Velocity: -48 km/s</li>
		<li>Diameter: 75 ly</li>
		<li>Angular Diameter: 10'</li>
		<li>Age: 2,000 years</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Characteristics:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>X-Ray source pulasar 1E 161348-5055 has led to investigations on periodicity
			<ul>
				<li>Discovered by the Einstein Observatory</li>
				<li>Period of 6.67 hours, making it the slowest rotating pulsar known</li>
				<li>The light curve can be quantitatively accounted for by models of propeller torques of both Illarionov-Sunyaev type and Romanova-Lovelace</li>
				<li>1-300 GeV spectrum and the total flux gives a luminosity of 8.3 × 1033 erg s–1 at a source distance of 3.3 kpc</li>
				<li>May have a magnetar nature</li>
				<li>Two magnetars may have passive fallback disks, this one and 4U 0142+61</li>
				<li>When the disk mass is high and the surface dipole field of the magnetar is as high as 4 × 10(15) G, the magnetar will evolve from the ejector phase to the propeller phase</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Pulsar flared and became 50 times brighter between October 1999 and January 2000</li>
		<li>One explanation for slow period is an unseen binary partner, making it a low mass x-ray binary
			<ul>
				<li>Interaction of magnetic fields causes it to slow down</li>
				<li>Explains flare, since mass could have transferred from partner</li>
				<li>Could have double accretion process, where it is capturing material directly from companion and into an accretion disk</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Another explanation for slow period is that magnetic fields interacted with debris from original supernova</li>
		<li>On June 22, 2016 the Swift telescope detected a short x-ray burst
			<ul>
				<li>Has intense x-ray fluctuations on the millisecond scale</li>
				<li>Similar to other magnetars</li>
				<li>Binary star explanation is unlikely because the x-ray fluctuations is highly irregular in energy and time</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>There is a Fermi γ-ray counterpart to RCW 103</li>

		<li>outer shell is 10 pc across and 1.9 pc thick
			<ul>
				<li>contains x-ray jets and a bow shock where the SE jet meets the shell</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Instead of radiating out symmetrically, W49B's exploding star shot more material out from its poles versus from its equator.</li>
		<li>There is evidence that W49B left behind a black hole - not a neutron star like most other supernovas.</li>
		<li>If confirmed, W49B would be the most recent black hole formed in our Galaxy.</li>
		<li>The structure of the circumstellar medium affect the metal distribution and composition of the SNR</li>
		<li>SN triggered by the collapse of a 25 M (☉) Wolf-Rayet star</li>
		<li>Model of bipolar/jet-driven core-collapse SNe</li>
		<li>Large level of asymmetry in the brightness distribution of the system, due to companion star located in front of the primary star</li>
		<li>W49B is indicative of a bipolar Type Ib/Ic SN origin, making it the first of its kind to be discovered in the Milky Way.</li>
		<li>The following sequence of events has been suggested to account for the X-ray and infrared data: A massive star formed from a dense cloud of dust and gas, shone brightly for a few million years while spinning off rings of gas and pushing them away to form a nearly empty cavity around the star. The star then exhausted its nuclear fuel and its core collapsed to form a black hole. Much of the gas around the black hole was pulled into it, but some, including material rich in iron and nickel was flung away in oppositely directed jets of gas traveling near the speed of light. When the jet hit the dense cloud surrounding the star, it flared out and drove a shock wave into the cloud.
		An observer aligned with one these jets would have seen a gamma-ray burst, a blinding flash in which the concentrated power equals that of ten quadrillion Suns for a minute or so. The view perpendicular to the jets would be a less astonishing, although nonetheless spectacular supernova explosion. For W49B, the jet is tilted out of the plane of the sky by about 20 degrees, but the remains of the jet are visible as a hot X-ray emitting bar of gas.</li>

<h2 id="M82">M82 X-2</h2>
	<h4>Properties:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>X-Ray Pulsar in Messier 82, the cigar galaxy, in binary system</li>
		<li>Also Known as:
			<ul>
				<li>J095550.9+694044</li>
				<li>J095551+6940.8</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Constellation: Ursa Major</li>
		<li>Right Ascension: 09h 55m 51.0s</li>
		<li>Declination: 69° 40′ 45″</li>
		<li>Distance 12 million ly</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Characteristics:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Very luminous, radiating energy equivalent to ten million Suns</li>
		<li>Has average size 1.4 sm and has a companion which is 5.2 sm</li>
		<li>Rotates every 1.37 seconds, and revolves around its companion every 2.5 days</li>
		<li>long term pattern changes over weeks or months</li>
		<li>ultraluminous x-ray source (ULX)
			<ul>
				<li>luminosity 100x greater than eddingtom limit</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>binary system
			<ul>
				<li>if the pulsar weighs 1.4 sm, companion is 5.2 sm</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>We find that the derived neutron star's dipole magnetic field depends the maximum accretion rate adopted, but is likely less than 10^13 G</li>
		<li>Its isotropic X-ray luminosity L_iso = 1.8 × 10^40 erg s^− 1 during outbursts is 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1.4 M_⊙ neutron star</li>
		<li>The accretion rate at the magnetospheric radius must be super-Eddington during outbursts</li>
		<li>the binary system that formed M82 X-2 is most likely less than 50 Myr old and contains a donor star which had an initial mass of approximately 8–10 sm</li>
		<li>We attribute the excess iron line emission to the ULX in its high state. In general, the iron K-shell luminosity of M82 is dominated by the diffuse component.</li>
		<li>In the M82 Galaxy, the three star clusters will eventually merge</li>
		<li>Luminosities of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are large when compared to the Eddington limit for isotropic accretion onto stellar-mass object. However, the recent discovery of coherent pulsations from ULX M82 X-1 has shown that another scenario implying accretion onto a magnetized neutron star is possible for ULXs. We have found no evidence for significant coherent pulsations in any of the sources including the M82 X-2.</li>

		<li>one of the brightest radio pulsar not detected in gamma rays</li>
		<li>jets are pointing straight at us</li>
		<li>trail from jet extends almost 5 ly because it is moving so fast</li>
		<li>Announced two extrasolar planets orbiting the pulsar, but observations ruled out this idea</li>
		<li>Suggests a small angle between the pulsar spin axis and our line of sight, as inferred from the radio data</li>
		<li>On larger scales, emission from the 7′7′ (≈2≈2 pc) tail is clearly seen, two faint extensions nearly orthogonal to the direction of the pulsar’s proper motion is also seen</li>
		<li>Surprisingly, the spectrum of the tail shows only a slight hint of cooling with increasing distance from the pulsar. This implies either a low magnetic field with fast flow speed, or particle reacceleration within the tail</li>
		<li>The density profile found for PSR B0355+54 shows a perfect exponential decrease towards the tube edge.</li>

		<li>Among the youngest X-ray binaries observed, 2,600 years old possibly</li>
		<li>We detect strong, variable H-alpha emission lines, consisting of multiple components which vary with orbital phase</li>
